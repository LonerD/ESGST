* Removed the "Bundled" and "Not Bundled" categories from Game Categories and added the "Full CV", "Reduced CV" and "No CV" categories. The "No CV" category is currently updated manually, so it might take some time until a game is added to the list. You must sync "Reduced CV Games" through the settings menu in this update otherwise the old "bundled" data will not appear.
* The "Giveaway Info" category from Game Categories and Real CV Calculator now both use the "No CV" data to correctly calculate the CV.

/*
 * August 14, 2017 - v6.Beta.26.2
 */

* Removed Game Categories from the new giveaway page, since SG now shows an asterisk there if the game is bundled.
* You can now sort the categories in Game Categories from the settings menu (you will find it at the end of the Game Categories section - Games.4).
* EXPERIMENTAL: Game Categories are now loaded from a Google Sheet instead of being stored locally (closes #291 and #302). If you're requesting games for the first time, it should take around 15 seconds for the categories to load, but every other time it should be a lot faster, sometimes loading instantly or after around 2 seconds. I believe this is a worth time to wait considering this method doesn't consume any memory. This method is experimental though, since I'm not sure if Google Sheets will be able to handle the request quota, but worst case scenario I can add a manual request method as fallback later.
* Added Game Categories data to the "Wipe Storage" button in the settings menu, now that this data is no longer stored locally and therefore useless to keep.

/*
 * August 13, 2017 - v6.Beta.26.1
 */

* Fixed a bug that was preventing some users from exporting data (closes #335).

/*

* Fixed a bug that was adding the Comment Formatting Helper panel to the keys text area in the new giveaway page.

Renamed the settings and sync pages:

* /esgst-settings -> /esgst/settings
* /esgst-sync -> /esgst/sync

Revamped the import/export/delete tools and added specific pages for them:

* /esgst/import
* /esgst/export
* /esgst/delete

WARNING: Any exported files from versions prior to v26.0 are no longer supported. If you have old exported files that you wish to make compatible with v26.0+, you'll have to downgrade to v25.5, import the file, upgrade to v26.0 and export it.

/*
 * August 10, 2017 - v6.Beta.25.0
 */

* Moved all data that doesn't need to be shared between SG and ST to localStorage, to start getting rid of GM_setValue/GM_getValue and hopefully improve the script's performance. This data includes: entries, giveaways, groups, rerolls, templates and winners. As a result, this data can no longer be managed through SteamTrades, only through SteamGifts. A button has been added to the settings menu to wipe the GM_setValue/GM_getValue data from the storage (make sure to backup through Tampermonkey before doing this).
* The script's settings page now has the title "ESGST Settings" and the icon of the script as favicon.

This update has a lot of changes, so I probably forgot to list some of them.

* Removed the settings menu from the account page. It's now accessible from any page by clicking on the ESGST button.
* You can now enable features specifically for SG or ST in the settings menu.
* Revamped the settings menu and enumerated all settings, making it easier to reference them.
* All feature descriptions will now be accessible from the settings menu, without the need to keep going back and forth between the settings menu and the GitHub page (this is a work in progress, some features are currently missing their description).
* New features and functionalities will now be marked with a [NEW] tag, so it's easier to locate what's new in the current version from the settings menu.
* Started a process of cloning SG's classes so the script no longer needs to rely on them, which will prevent any possible conflict from SG's script (solves an issue that wasn't opening the header menu on Firefox, and another issue that was replacing the ESGST button with the profile button on ST).

* Brought back avatars to Grid View.
* Giveaway Groups Loader now shows group avatars again.
* Improved how the groups are synced in Stickied Giveaway Groups and upgraded the group storage (unfortunately, unlike previous storage upgrades, this upgrade cannot retain your stickied groups, so you will have to sticky your groups again). You must sync through the settings menu (section 9) immediately, otherwise none of the group features will work correctly in this version.

/*
 * June 20, 2017 - v6.Beta.10.1
 */

Here's more info about it: giveaways that have not started yet will not appear in the list of bookmarked giveaways; instead, they will stay in a sort of hidden state until they start; when they start, the header bookmark button will turn green, indicating that you must open the list of bookmarked giveaways so that the started giveaways can be updated with their end times; when giveaways are about to end, the button will continue to turn red as before, but if there are both started and ending giveaways, the button will be colored with a brown-ish color; hovering over the button also gives you more details about how many giveaways have started and/or are ending.

* Fixed an issue that was breaking discussion titles (closes #153).

 */

You can now mark comments as unread (closes #128). Read comments and visited giveaways/discussions are no longer faded out - their background now changes to grey (possible solution to #143). The feature now works in the inbox page.

* Giveaway Filters now has a separate setting for each of the giveaway pages (all, recommended, wishlist, group, new).
* Added some titles and tooltips to Giveaway Filters.

* Enter/Leave Giveaway Button - Fixed some bugs (closes #136 and #146). The feature now automatically detects if you own the game (you must of course sync through the settings menu) or if the giveaway is for a higher level than you and does not show the Enter button in case one of these is true (closes #132). Entered giveaways are now immediately hidden if the filter is enabled (closes #129). If an error occurs while entering a giveaway or if you don't have enough points, the button will simply turn red instead of adding an additional button to its side (partial solution to #89). Brought back the option to add a comment to the giveaway upon entering.

Added the following features:

 */

* Fixed a conflict between games' app/sub ids. As a result, Multi-Tag and the option to import/export game data have been temporarily disabled until they are rewritten for the new system.

Removed the following features:

* Giveaway Description/Comment Box Popup - Upon clicking the Enter/Leave giveaway button, the script now checks for a description. If it finds one, it opens the giveaway in a new tab so you can read it before entering, otherwise it enters the giveaway automatically.

/*
 * June 2, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.13
 */

* Added the option to show points in the title to Header Refresher, and the option to show an icon in the title to highlight new messages. The icon chosen was "fire", because you got new messages, so you're "hot". If anyone has a better suggestion, feel free to let me know.
* Separated the option to notify delivered gifts from Header Refresher back into Delivered Gifts Notifier.
* Fixed a bug in Endless Scrolling that was happening while refreshing a page.
* Fixed a bug in Giveaway Encrypter/Decrypter that was happening for giveaways with multiple copies.

* Endless Scrolling no longer alters the title/URL of the page.
* Added/changed some icons in the simplified version of Game Categories.

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Header Refresher - If multiple tabs are open, only one tab will now make requests to refresh the header and then it will sync the changes with the other tabs (this happens instantly with Tampermonkey). The number of delivered wins will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (2W). The icon of the tab is no longer changed, the message count will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (5M). The level on SG and the reputation on ST are now refreshed as well, but they will not appear in the title of the tab. Points are updated instantly and refreshed across all open tabs when using Enter/Leave Giveaway Button with Tampermonkey (with Greasemonkey, it will still update, but only after 60 seconds). An example of all items combined: (2W) (5M) (150P) SteamGifts

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.10
 */

* Added back the option to sync using the Steam API key, but made it optional. If there is a Steam API key saved, it will sync using both Steam API key and login, otherwise it will sync using only login.
* Added the option to enable a simplified version of Game Categories that can either show initials of the categories or icons (suggestions for the icons are always welcome, as I wasn't sure which icon to choose for some categories).

 */

* Added the option to highlight multiple wins as positive to Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker, as multiple wins often cannot be fixed.
* Added the option to color the usernames instead of adding an icon next to them to Whitelist/Blacklist Checker. If this option is enabled, Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker highlights will automatically appear as icons to avoid conflict.

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.7
 */

Renamed the following features:

* Exclusive Giveaways -> Giveaways Encrypter/Decrypter - This prevents any confusion about the nature of this feature. The giveaways are not really exclusive (anyone can see them in the source code of the page), this feature simply decrypts them and hands them over to the user (closes #125).

/*
 * May 23, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.3
